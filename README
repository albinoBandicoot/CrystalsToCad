.mol2 to .scad converter

This program builds on the functionality of the current .mol2 to .scad converter. It includes these features:

- space filling and ball-and-stick modes
- colored atoms in F5 preview
- a simple GUI (can also run from command line)
- is somewhat more robust and extensible than the current one.

Overview of the files:

Point.java		- basic methods for working with 3D points
Atom.java		- defines a single atom in the molecule, generates SCAD code for the atom spheres
Bond.java		- defines a bond, generates SCAD code for the bonds
Molecule.java	- a whole molecule (just a list of atoms and a list of bonds)
Converter.java	- code for reading the .mol2 file and top-level routine for writing the .scad file; also contains
					the command-line main method.
CrystalsToCAD.java	- graphical user interface.

To run the GUI, just run 

	java CrystalsToCAD

after you've compiled everything (which you can do by typing 'javac *.java' from the command line)

To run from the command line, run

	java Converter [options] input_file

The options are:
	-sf			use space filling model (default)
	-bs			use ball and stick model
	-o <file>	use <file> as the output file, instead of a file automatically constructed from the input file name.
